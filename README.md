# Todo_App
I have created a To-Do App using React that allows users to manage tasks with three main features: Add, Edit, and Delete. Users can add new tasks using a text input, edit existing tasks with an "Edit" button and save the changes, and delete tasks permanently using a "Delete" button. This app provides an easy and efficient way to manage a task list.
